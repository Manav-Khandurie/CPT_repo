### About the Project
> The Movie Pal application, constructed on the MERN stack and deployed on Azure, is currently grappling with performance challenges that hinder the seamless user experience. Key issues include prolonged data retrieval times from the Azure SQL database, inefficiencies in API calls to TMDb , and potential resource-intensive operations within the React frontend. These bottlenecks collectively compromise the application's responsiveness, impacting user engagement and satisfaction. The resolution of these performance issues is crucial to ensure swift access to movie information, trailers, and related content, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining the competitiveness and growth trajectory of Movie Pal.
